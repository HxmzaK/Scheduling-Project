Comments on Sara's Process Models.
-Waterfall
I really like that she added all the specific system requirements.
Her Waterfall model was virtually flawless there was nothing I would change.

-Incremental
Again really good process models the only thing I would add is a short description of what the incremental process model does just to set some frame of reference.

-Integration and Configuration
She used the same general outline for the waterfall process and changed the software design and implementation portion.
I think she definitely could have added a github link to the program she was referencing when she says that she found a github program.
