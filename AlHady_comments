Comments for Hamza Khalid

Waterfall Model: I think Hamza was not specific in his description, he was stating the process/model in a big picture. In general he stated all the stages and what he would do for any project not only for this example

Incremental: I couldn't figure out what's the starting user/point in the design and implementation phase. With which user will you start? and why? Will you be doing all features at the same time, or dividing them to give the customer a fast delivery?

Integration: I really liked Hamza's model, the open-sources he used and found are very similar to our project, and they can help us a lot. I think this is the best described model for Hamza
